    *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel's supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll's loyal butler.

-----

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
* [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
